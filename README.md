# Missing Quotes in getElementById
This example demonstrates a common error in JavaScript when accessing HTML elements using their ID with getElementById().  The code is missing quotes around the ID resulting in a runtime error.

**Bug:**
The script attempts to access the element with the ID `myDiv` without quotes around the ID. This is syntactically incorrect and will lead to a runtime error.

**Solution:**
The solution is to correctly enclose the ID in quotes.
